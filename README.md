Dataset and R code associated with the Barosa et al 2022 paper on the geochemistry and 16S rRNA microbial diversity of the shallow-water hydrothermal vents of the Aeolian Islands, Italy.

The repository contains the following files:

- README.md (this readme file)
- Barosa_et_al_16SrRNA_analysis.r (the r code to reproduce the figures)
- aeo19_dataset.csv (the environmental dataset containg also the geochemistry)
- Barosa_et_al_supplementary_table_1.csv (the compilation of geochemical data from the literature)

The raw fastq files for the sequencing can be accessed with on the ENA website with the project code [PRJEB54611](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB54611) the under the *CoEvolve: Coevolution of Geosphere and Biosphere* umbrella project ([PRJEB55081](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB55081)).

THis project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (Grant agreement No. 948972) ERC-STG-2020 project CoEvolve.
