Dataset and R code associated with the Barosa et al 2022 paper on the geochemistry and 16S rRNA microbial diversity of the shallow-water hydrothermal vents of the Aeolian Islands, Italy.

The repository contains the following files:

- README.md (this readme file)
- Barosa_et_al_16SrRNA_analysis.r (the r code to reproduce the figures)
- aeo19_dataset.csv (the environmental dataset containg also the geochemistry)
- Barosa_et_al_supplementary_table_1.csv (the compilation of geochemical data from the literature)
